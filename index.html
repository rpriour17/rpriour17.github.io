      <section>

        <p>Hi! My name is Romain Priour, and I am a graduate of the UC Berkeley Class of 2022, with a Bachelors in Computer Science. My professional interests 
          include full stack and mobile development with an emphasis on backend, machine learning and data analytics. I also love the product side of 
          software development, and have a passion for working with product managers and stakeholders to provide the most desired functionality. Outside of school and 
          work I like to go to the beach, go on hikes, hang out with friends and discover new music genres. 
        </p>
